Description: Estimating causal effects from observational studies targeting
    new estimands for treatment policies assuming clustered (or
    partial) interference, as discussed by Barkley et al. (in submission). 
    The key implementation is estimating the distribution of treatment in 
    counterfactual scenarios in which the policies are implemented.
