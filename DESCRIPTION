Description: Estimating causal effects from observational studies assuming 
    clustered (or partial) interference. These IPW estimators target new 
    estimands arising from population-level treatment policies. The estimands 
    and estimators are introduced in Barkley et. al (2017); see 
    <arXiv:1711.04834>.
