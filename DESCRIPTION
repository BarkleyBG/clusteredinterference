Description: Estimating causal effects from observational studies targeting
    nonranomized implementation of treatment policies assuming clustered (or
    partial) interference, as discussed by Barkley and Hudgens 201X. The key
    implementation is estimating the distribution of treatment in counterfactual
    scenarios in which the policies are implemented.
