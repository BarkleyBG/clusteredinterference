# clusteredinterference 1.0.0

- Initial CRAN release of 'clusteredinterference' package!
    - This package implements the estimators proposed in [Barkley et al. (2017), _Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered Interference_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04834) for estimating the causal effects of different treatment policies in the presence of partial or clustered interference.
- See the estimation function `policyFX()` for more information.
