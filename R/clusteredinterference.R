#' Draw Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered Interference
#'
#' \pkg{clusteredinterference} implements the estimators from Barkley et al.,
#' (201X), \emph{Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered
#' Interference}. These are inverse probability of treatment-weighted estimators
#' for estimating the causal effects on outcomes of population-level treatment
#' policies.
#'
#' These estimators are implemented in one function, \code{\link{policyFX}}. A
#' healthy amount of documentation can be found in the vignette included in this
#' package.
