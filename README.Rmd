# About the `clusteredinterference` package

This package implements the estimators proposed in [Barkley et al. (2017), _Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered Interference_.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04834)


## What is clustered interference?

### What is interference?

In causal inference, when one individual's treatment may affect another individual's outcome, it's often called **interference**. In most applications, it is assumed that there is no interference whatsoever. In some applications this must be relaxed; i.e., as in infectious disease research.

### Clustered interference is partial interference

A relaxation of the assumption of "no interference" is to assume that individuals may be partitioned into distinct clusters of individuals (e.g., households, or classrooms, etc.) such that there may be interference within the clusters, but not between the clusters. Historically, this assumption has been referred to as **partial interference** after Sobel (2006). 

[Barkley et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04834) introduces the terminology **clustered interference** to refer to this same assumption. This phrase may be sufficiently descriptive of the underlying assumption, and perhaps clarifies the presumed restriction of interference to clusters. 


# About the method

[Barkley et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04834) proposes new causal estimands for defining treatment effects in the context of observational studies when there may be interference or spillover effects between units in the same cluster. The manuscript also introduces IPTW estimators for thos estimands, which are implemented in `clusteredinterference`.

# Using the `clusteredinterference` package

## Install the package

You'll need to use the `devtools` package to install \href{https://github.com/BarkleyBG/clusteredinterference}{from GitHub}:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("BarkleyBG/clusteredinterference")
```

### Architectures supported

This package has been checked on several operating systems with \href{https://github.com/r-hub/rhub}{`rhub`} package. 

| Platform  | Latest succesful check |
| ----- | -----|
|macOS 10.11 El Capitan, R-release (experimental)| v0.3.0 |
|Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-release, 32/64 bit | v0.3.0|


## Load this package 

```{r}
library(clusteredinterference)
```

## A quick data example

```{r} 
data("toy_data")
head(toy_data)
```

## Estimation

Estimation is carried out with one function:

```{r} 
set.seed(1113)
causal_fx <- policyFX(
  data = toy_data,
  formula = Outcome | Treatment ~ Age + Distance + (1 | Cluster_ID) | Cluster_ID,
  alphas = c(.15, .25), 
  k_samps = 1
)
```


```{r}
knitr::kable(causal_fx$estimates, digits = 3)
```

## Vignette

The vignette provides more information on the formal arguments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("clusteredinterference")
```
